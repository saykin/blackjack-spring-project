This is a project to learn Spring, 
there will be a lot of changes as I learn how this all works.

1. At the moment I fell happy with the current structure of my code, that's why I have 
stopped working on this project for a bit. At the moment I'm learning JS and React so
I can create a frontend for this project.

2. When I'm done with a basic React app next step will be creating a way for 
one player to play against the house.  

3. Next step is several players playing against the house. They will join by having the 
direct link to the session.

4. After the first two steps, I'd like to implement a search for game sessions players 
can join that still has available spots.

5. When those systems are in place, I'd like to implement a way for users to register 
so that they can be ranked on how much virtual money they have won. Player with the most 
virtual cash, will be ranked higher.
