<h1>TEST</h1>
<div th:each="w : ${vinner}">
    <p th:text="${w}"></p>

    <p>The logic is from a case I solved for an interview, where Hama draws cards until he has more than 17.</p>
    <p>Magnus then draws cards until he has more points than Hama.</p>
    <p>This is just a playtest to check that the game actually works and gives me the correct winner and cards.</p>
    <p>I will be further developing this into a REST API, so many changes will probably be done to the code.</p>
